# 1UP Nintendo 64 Joystick Analysis

Hey what's up, I wanted to make an analysis post about what I'm calling the "1UP Stick." The 1UP Stick is a Nintendo 64 replacement stick assembly made by [1UP Retro](https://1upretro.com/). As a competetive Super Smash Bros 64 player, a good joystick is paramount. Below is my analysis of the stick.

I get pretty deep into the weeds, but if you're anything like me, you'll enjoy the thorougness. I make a few references to movement patterns made in Smash 64, so if you don't play that game at a competetive level, you might not understand the references. You can find the stick [here on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-64-Analog-Replacement-Joystick-Part/dp/B077H95N5M/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=renshijie86-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=6563a29ca57562e7f6e6ac409796504d&creativeASIN=B077H95N5M).

## 1. My thoughts after 10-15 hours of play time

For the first time in maybe ever, I feel like I now have a viable drop-in replacement for a busted or worn-down Nintendo 64 joystick. By viable I mean it feels 90-95% as good as an OG stick from Nintendo. Other people have tried to replicate the N64 joystick and its parts, e.g. Enkko (lol) and Kitsch-Bent, but both have fallen short by some margin. This stick virtually nails it.

## 1.1 How it feels

Overall, it feels like a 9/10 stick one would find at a yard sale or on eBay. Which is to say, very good. Here are few key points:

#### The Good:

- Smash 64 tilts are just as easy with this stick as with an OG stick. Other potentiometer-based sticks (Derek Stick et. al) had a small tilt zone. This is not an issue on the 1UP stick.
- The 1UP joystick has a more matte feel to it, and has a bit better grip.
- The snapback feels almost identical, which is one of the 1UP stick's main selling points for me. Pivots in Smash 64 feel great.
- The range feels normal, and DI also feels normal. I still need to put the range ROM onto my everdrive and test. I'll probably update this post later with that info.

#### The Not-So Good:
- There is a slight amound of grinding on certain vertices of movement. In the case of my stick, lateral movement on the right side experienced slight grinding. Vertical movement on the upper half experienced a clicking/sticking point. The lateral grinding is less apparent while playing Smash, and more apparent while playing a racing game like MarioKart or Diddy Kong Racing, with lots of back-and-forth lateral movement on the stick. Based on my measurements, this is the result of the inside gear size and the optical cog diameter having _slight_ incongruence. More on that later, in the measurements section.
- There is a slight stick wobble dead spot. This is a result of the upper gear being thinner than it should be on the inside. I'll show measurements on that below. Here's a video of the deadzone:

- The stick, bowl, and gears appear to be made of similar material as the original, and are thus subject to the same wear and tear as the original. Putting some super lube in the bowl helped, and will likely help with wear and tear.

## 2 Measurements
I'll show side-by-side images with micrometer measurements. The first image will always be the new 1up stick. The second is from a 10/10 pristine, brand-new original N64 controller, for comparison.

As you can see here, the 1UP stick is a bit longer, by about 0.1mm. This difference is manifest mainly in the bottom nib of the stick. You can see that the 1UP stick's nib is slightly larger. Associatively, this means that the 1UP stick's bowl is slightly deeper. We'll go into that later.

## 2.2 The Bowl

The width measurements are slightly different, at 0.9mm. The outside width is the same, which simply means that the plastic wall is a bit thinner on both sides.

### 2.2.2 Bowl Depth

I forgot to get a good shot of this, and have no good way to measure this, but it stands to reason that the bowl of the 1UP stick is slightly deeper to accommodate the slightly longer stick. 

### 2.2.3 Bowl Optical Cog Size

This part was really interesting to me. The 1UP stick's cogs are much smaller in diameter, which, as you'll see, results in larger gears to make up for such a small cog diameter.

Something also interesting (and rather hard to see in the images) is that the number of optical notches in the cog wheel (the perforations in the wheel that the cog is attached to) is less on the 1UP bowl than it is on the original bowl. I haven't noticed any less accuracy in input movement, but this seems to me like it would result in less input vectors being delivered to the machine hardware.
